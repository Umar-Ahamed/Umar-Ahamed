# Hi, I'm Umar!  
[Programmer](https://github.com/Umar-Ahamed), [Cybersecurity Professional](https://www.linkedin.com/in/umar-ahamed-2120392b5)
## About Me


I am a passionate IT and cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in technical support, networking, and security operations. I hold the CompTIA Trifecta (A+, Network+, and Security+) as well as the CompTIA IT Operations Specialist (CIOS) and CompTIA Secure Infrastructure Specialist (CSIS) stackable certifications.

My experience includes managing SIEM systems, analyzing security events, and using ethical hacking tools such as Nmap, Burp Suite, and Metasploit to identify and assess vulnerabilities. I ranked in the Top 100 in the Hackfinity TryHackMe CTF after joining three days late, which demonstrates my problem solving skills and dedication to continuous learning.

I am currently focusing on advancing into a SOC Analyst or Information Security role where I can apply my technical expertise to protect systems, investigate threats, and strengthen organizational security.
